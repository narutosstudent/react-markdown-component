## IndexOf

`indexOf` returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string, or -1 if it's not found. It takes an optional second argument, which is the index to start searching from.

Example: `indexOf('hello world', 'world')` returns 6, 6 being the index of the 7th character in the string.

## \n

`\n` is the newline character. It's used to indicate a new line in a string. It's treated as a single character. Twice would not mean 4 characters, but 2.
